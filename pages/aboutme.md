### 1. Programming
<p style="text-align: justify"> </p>

#### 1.1 Python 
* <p style="text-align: justify"> This summer, I took a class of Python (CSE231) and learned various data structures of Python, including string, function, list, tuple, dictionary, set, class and so on. Finished the readings of Chapters 1-9, 11-12 of the book <i> The Practice of Computing Using Python </i> .[1]</p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> Here I attached the list of the 6 class projects I have finished using Python. If you have interest, please check the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lp1VTEmsLFz93kLzTfxlGmvEO5mB_0y6?usp=sharing">link</a>. So far during the past 2 months, I have gained an experience of Python of 3,000 ~ 4,000 lines. </p>

#### 1.2 GitHub  
* <p style="text-align: justify"> This summer, I get familiar with the GitHub platform and its Markdown language, and finished the goal of setting up a personal website on GitHub. </p>

#### 1.3 Matlab
* <p style="text-align: justify"> While entering MSU in the fall semester of 2017, I self-studied Matlab with an initial objective to prepare for the class projects of MSE 862 (Dislocation Theory). Here I uploaded several <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kXQ8amdsIHOGrlMsHyeI-OOyRCg-v3va?usp=sharing">examples</a> of Matlab codes I wrote to express pole figures in crystals. </p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> While taking the class MSE 991 (Computational Materials Science), I also got the chance to write several Molecular Dynamics (MD) programsin Matlab. Here are some of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/153voqd3fobC8xD0aex3zamI0bneFZyaA?usp=sharing"> examples</a>. </p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> So far, I have an experience of Matlab of around 3,000 lines.</p>

#### 1.4 Java (Also C++)

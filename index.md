## Hello!
<p style="text-align: justify"> My name is Yining He, and I am currently a PhD candidate in the the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science department, Michigan State University. My advisor is Professor Wei Lai (<a href="https://weilaigroup.org">Weilai Group</a>). My expected graduation date is August 2025, and I am now looking for internship opportunities in industry for the 2024 Summer.</p>

### Education
- **PhD Program**, Michigan State University (MSU)<br />
_Major: Materials Science, 2017 â€“ Present_

<p style="text-align: justify"> Project 1: Used machine-learning (ML) based interatomic potentials (IPs) to investigate the Na ion diffusion behavior and dynamics inside the electrode materials (Sodium Nickle titanates, Nax[NiTi]O2) of the Sodium-ion battery (SIB). As compared to the traditional IPs, this new machine-learning based IP is more accurate and run much faster, meaning a much reduced computation cost. With this machine-learning based IP, we demonstrated the diffusion mechanisms of Na ions, which povides insights for future SIB electrode design.

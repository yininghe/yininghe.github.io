### 1. Programming
<p style="text-align: justify"> </p>

#### 1.1 Python 
* <p style="text-align: justify"> This summer, I took a class of Python (CSE231) and learned various data structures of Python, including string, function, list, tuple, dictionary, set, class and so on. Finished the readings of Chapters 1-9, 11-12 of the book <i> The Practice of Computing Using Python </i> .[1]</p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> Here I attached the list of the 6 class projects I have finished using Python. If you have interest, please check the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lp1VTEmsLFz93kLzTfxlGmvEO5mB_0y6?usp=sharing">link</a>. So far during the past 2 months, I have gained an experience of Python of 3,000 ~ 4,000 lines. </p>

#### 1.2 GitHub  
* <p style="text-align: justify"> This summer, I get familiar with the GitHub platform and its Markdown language, and finished the goal of setting up a personal website on GitHub. </p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> In addition, I find that there are many open source projects and resources regarding with the materials simulation on GitHub and I think that GitHub would be more and more popular in the materials simulation community. In the future, maybe more and more people will choose to publish their simulation records/results or even codes on Github for peer review, after their simulation/modeling papers have been published. </p>

#### 1.3 Matlab
* <p style="text-align: justify"> While entering MSU in the fall semester of 2017, I self-studied Matlab with an initial objective to prepare for the class projects of MSE 862 (Dislocation Theory). Here I uploaded several <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kXQ8amdsIHOGrlMsHyeI-OOyRCg-v3va?usp=sharing">examples</a> of Matlab codes I wrote to express pole figures in crystals. </p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> While taking the class MSE 991 (Computational Materials Science), I also got the chance to write several Molecular Dynamics (MD) programsin Matlab. Here are some of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/153voqd3fobC8xD0aex3zamI0bneFZyaA?usp=sharing"> examples</a>. </p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> So far, I have an experience of Matlab of around 3,000 lines. </p>

#### 1.4 Java (Also C++ and the Terminal Environment)
<p style="text-align: justify"> </p>

###### Java:
* <p style="text-align: justify"> While taking the class CSCI 455 (Introduction to Programming Systems Design) at USC, I learned various data structures of Java and finished the readings of Chapters 1-7, 9-14, 17 of the book <i> Big Java: Early Objects </i> .[1] Also learned some algorithms, like the sorting and searching algorithm. </p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> Finished 4 class projects using Java. Here are two examples: (i) Writing a console-based program to simulate a trial of tossing 2 coins some number of times and display the results in bar graph. (ii) Applying recursive search algorithm to search for a path that connects any two random points in a 2D maze. So far, I have an experience of Java of around 3,000 lines. </p>

###### C++:
* <p style="text-align: justify"> I also learned C++ in the class CSCI 455 and finished 2 class projects using C++. These 2 projects are: (i) writing a program to record and arrange students’ names and corresponding scores in various required order, by implementing a data structure: hash table, with the use of linked lists (ii) Writing a console-based program to input a list of numbers, sort the number list by applying insertion sort algorithm, and split the even numbers from the old numbers. So far, I have an experience of C++ of around 1,500 lines. </p>

###### Terminal Commands:
* <p style="text-align: justify"> Got familiar with the Terminal environment and various command lines in the class CSCI 455. </p>

#### 1.5 Fortran 
* <p style="text-align: justify"> While taking the class MASC 575 (Basics of Atomistic Simulation of Materials) at USC, I self-studied  the syntax of Fortran to prepare for the class projects. Here are 2 simple example programs I wrote in Fortran: (i) Writing Fortran codes to calculate the π value in 2 ways. (a) Circle/Square Area Ratio; (b) Mathematical Integral. (ii) Writing Fortran codes to calculate the expectation values of x, x^2 , x^3 , x^4 , where x is subjected to Boltzmann distribution function centered at x = 0.5 at 3 different temperatures. So far, I have an experience of Fortran of around 500 lines.</p> 

### 2. Experimental
* <p style="text-align: justify"> DSC, TGA, FT-IR, SEM, XRD, German RepRap X400 (3D printer), operations of general wafer processing in cleanroom. </p>


### 3. Personal Life 
<p style="text-align: justify"> </p>

#### 3.1 Networking (Sigma Phi Delta Fraternity)
* <p style="text-align: justify"> To broaden my professional horizons and improve my networking skills, I joined Sigma Phi Delta while at USC, which is an international professional-social fraternity for engineers. I got to know many alumni there and learned a lot from their experience. </p>

#### 3.2 USC & Tibet --- Volunteer Teachers
* <p style="text-align: justify"> In the first year at USC, I participated in the Inner City Tutoring Program organized by the USC Caruso Catholic Center, and volunteered to be a Math tutor every Monday afternoon at the St. Columbkille School for almost 7 months. </p>

* <p style="text-align: justify"> In the July of year 2013 and 2014, I volunteered to be a teacher for one month at Lhasa Caiquan Welfare Special School in Tibet for twice. </p>


#### 3.3 Hobbies: Soccer & Table Tennis
* <p style="text-align: justify"> I like to play soccer and table tennis during my spare time. I usually play right-back on the field and I am good at speed and short passing. </p>

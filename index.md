## Hello!
<p style="text-align: justify"> My name is Yining He, and I am currently a PhD candidate in the the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science department, Michigan State University. My advisor is Professor Wei Lai (<a href="https://weilaigroup.org">Weilai Group</a>). My expected graduation date is August 2025, and I am now looking for internship opportunities in industry for the 2024 Summer.</p>


### Research Projects
**Project 1**: 
<p style="text-align: justify"> Used machine-learning (ML) based interatomic potentials (IPs) to investigate the Na ion diffusion behavior and dynamics inside the electrode materials (Sodium Nickle titanates, Nax[NiTi]O2) of the Sodium-ion battery (SIB). As compared to the traditional IPs, this new machine-learning based IP is more accurate and run much faster, meaning a much reduced computation cost. With this machine-learning based IP, we demonstrated the diffusion mechanisms of Na ions, which povides insights for future Na-ion battery electrode design. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116298">Link to the paper</a>). </p>

**Project 2**: 
<p style="text-align: justify"> Currently working on using interatomic potentials (IPs) to investigate the H2 and ion diffusion inside ionic liquids which could be used for H2 detector. </p>

## Hello!
<p style="text-align: justify"> My name is Yining He, and I am currently a PhD candidate in the the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science department, Michigan State University. My advisor is Professor Wei Lai (<a href="https://weilaigroup.org">Weilai Group</a>). My expected graduation date is August 2025, and I am now looking for internship opportunities in industry for the 2024 Summer.</p>


### Research Interests and Projects
  
<p style="text-align: justify"> With the rapid development of the computing power, materials modeling/simulation has become more and more powerful as a tool to study materials' properties besides theory and experiments. Nowadays, it has been used to predict materials properties and provide us physical insight to some phenomena, for example, it could predict the properties of materials “<i>that have not (yet) been synthesized or are at atomistic scales that cannot be readily interrogated experimentally</i>”.[1] I believe this materials modeling/simulation field will develop very fast in the foreseeable future, with the dramatic development of chip hardware/software/algorithms (i.e. the use of machine learning). </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> For the programming part, I have taken classes about Python and Java while at MSU and USC in order to learn these two languages systematically. I have also self-studied Matlab while at MSU and Fortran while at USC. If you would like to know more about what I have prepared for the programming part, please check <a href="pages/aboutme">ABOUT ME</a>. </p>

## Hello!
<p style="text-align: justify"> My name is Yining He, and I am currently a student in the PhD program of the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science department. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> I am now looking for research opportunities related to materials simulation and modeling, especially the field that studies the structure-property relationship of materials. I do not have a preference for the kind of materials to be studied. In general, I have interest in both inorganic materials (like crystals) and polymers. I am more interested in the microscale-level and mesoscale-level modeling/simulation, but if needed, I'd like to do the macroscale-level modeling/simulation work as well. </p>

### Why Do I Want to Work on Materials Simulation/Modeling?
<p style="text-align: justify"> Ever since I left my previous research group in the November of 2019, I have been reflecting on myself and thinking what I should do afterwards. After consideration and talking with some professors/senior students/friends, I think that Materials Simulation/Modeling is a very promising reseach field, and finally make up my mind to work on this area. </p>
  
<p style="text-align: justify"> With the rapid development of the computing power, materials modeling/simulation has become more and more powerful as a tool to study materials' properties besides theory and experiments. Nowadays, it has been used to predict materials properties and provide us physical insight to some phenomena, for example, it could predict the properties of materials “<i>that have not (yet) been synthesized or are at atomistic scales that cannot be readily interrogated experimentally</i>”.[1] I believe this materials modeling/simulation field will develop very fast in the foreseeable future, along with the dramatic development of chip hardware/software/algotithms (i.e. the use of machine learning). </p>

### Why I Think That I am Capable of Working on This Area & My Preparation

I think that I have the ability to work in this area

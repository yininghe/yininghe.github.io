# Study Notes
* <p style="text-align: justify"> Here I uploaded a list of my notes I have made so far while reading papers or watching Youtube Explanation Videos related to the field of materials simulation/modeling. I hope that these notes could be beneficial to those new starters (like myself) who want to do research on materials simulation/modeling. </p>

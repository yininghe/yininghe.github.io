## Hello!
<p style="text-align: justify"> My name is Yining He, and I am currently a student in the PhD program of the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science department. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> I am now looking for research opportunities related to materials simulation and modeling, especially the field that studies the structure-property relationship of materials. I do not have a preference for the kind of materials to be studied. In general, I have interest in both inorganic materials (like crystals) and polymers. In addition, I am more interested in the microscale-level and mesoscale-level modeling, but if needed, it also works for me to do the macroscale-level modeling work. </p>
